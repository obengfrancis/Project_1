# Postfix Evaluator and Source-to-Source Translator
This project implement an evaluator to solve postfix expressions and a converter to
translate postfix expressions to infix expressions. Infix expressions require parenthesis to
ensure correct operator associativity. Postfix expressions do not. 
This means that infix expressions can be ambiguous in meaning and postfix expressions are not.
